# Room 25 Helper

This is a simple webapp to help with keeping track of rooms in the game "Room 25"

Think of it as a grid of post-it notes that you can change the colors of and add 
notes, and then shift columns and rows just like in the game.

The rooms initially with '?' notes are the initial edge rooms that may contain the exit.
